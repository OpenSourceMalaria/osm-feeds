Have any of these structures been screened against Malaria and if so, what activities did they show?\r\nEach structure should be searched in PubChem (http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) and ChEMBL (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/) databases to identify any active compounds and the results posted.\r\n2.  Are any of these compounds/analogs commercially available?\r\nBefore embarking on synthesis, the team would like to establish whether suitable analogs can be purchased. Commercial databases should be searched and results posted.\r\n3. Do existing syntheses exist?\r\nIf suitable commercial analogs cannot be sourced, proposed synthetic routes (ideally with referenced literature procedures) should be posted.\r\n\r\nOnce questions 1-3 have been answered and results posted in the GitHub comment. The author should make a conclusion on viability/importantance of the target based on their findings. The issue can be marked as resolved and findings discussed in the next open meeting (https://plus.google.com/u/0/114702323662314783325/posts/V8Y648iKde6).\r\n\r\nFollowing the consultation, the target compounds will be highlighted and summarised in the public domain.","creator":{"login":"alintheopen","id":2626599,"avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/c2471ff5e662c17f7a0455ab67d97729?d=https://a248.e.akamai.net/assets.github.com%2Fimages%2Fgravatars%2Fgravatar-user-420.png","gravatar_id":"c2471ff5e662c17f7a0455ab67d97729","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alintheopen","html_url":"https://github.com/alintheopen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alintheopen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alintheopen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alintheopen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alintheopen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alintheopen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alintheopen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alintheopen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alintheopen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alintheopen/received_events","type":"User"},"open_issues":1,"closed_issues":7,"state":"open","created_at":"2013-05-10T05:12:06Z","updated_at":"2013-05-13T05:50:14Z","due_on":"2013-05-13T07:00:00Z"},"comments":5,"created_at":"2013-05-10T06:44:29Z","updated_at":"2013-05-20T00:40:29Z","closed_at":null,"pull_request":{"html_url":null,"diff_url":null,"patch_url":null},"body":"![github7](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/2626599/486894/2bed8c20-b93d-11e2-9412-0d192c265a62.png)\r\nInChI=1S/C13H12N4O2S/c14-10-5-2-6-11-12(10)17-13(16-11)8-3-1-4-9(7-8)20(15,18)19/h1-7H,14H2,(H,16,17)(H2,15,18,19)"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OSDDMalaria/OSDDMalaria_To_Do_List/issues/4","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OSDDMalaria/OSDDMalaria_To_Do_List/issues/4/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OSDDMalaria/OSDDMalaria_To_Do_List/issues/4/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OSDDMalaria/OSDDMalaria_To_Do_List/issues/4/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OSDDMalaria/OSDDMalaria_To_Do_List/issues/4","id":14137286,"number":4,"title":"Remake

issue the team would like answers to the following questions:\r\n\r\n1. Have any of these structures been screened against Malaria and if so, what activities did they show?\r\nEach structure should be searched in PubChem (http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) and ChEMBL (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/) databases to identify any active compounds and the results posted.\r\n2.  Are any of these compounds/analogs commercially available?\r\nBefore embarking on synthesis, the team would like to establish whether suitable analogs can be purchased. Commercial databases should be searched and results posted.\r\n3. Do existing syntheses exist?\r\nIf suitable commercial analogs cannot be sourced, proposed synthetic routes (ideally with referenced literature procedures) should be posted.\r\n\r\nOnce questions 1-3 have been answered and results posted in the GitHub comment. The author should make a conclusion on viability/importantance of the target based on their findings. The issue can be marked as resolved and findings discussed in the next open meeting (https://plus.google.com/u/0/114702323662314783325/posts/V8Y648iKde6).\r\n\r\nFollowing the consultation, the target

issue the team would like answers to the following questions:\r\n\r\n1. Have any of these structures been screened against Malaria and if so, what activities did they show?\r\nEach structure should be searched in PubChem (http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) and ChEMBL (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/) databases to identify any active compounds and the results posted.\r\n2.  Are any of these compounds/analogs commercially available?\r\nBefore embarking on synthesis, the team would like to establish whether suitable analogs can be purchased. Commercial databases should be searched and results posted.\r\n3. Do existing syntheses exist?\r\nIf suitable commercial analogs cannot be sourced, proposed synthetic routes (ideally with referenced literature procedures) should be posted.\r\n\r\nOnce questions 1-3 have been answered and results posted in the GitHub comment. The author should make a conclusion on viability/importantance of the target based on their findings. The issue can be marked as resolved and findings discussed in the next open meeting (https://plus.google.com/u/0/114702323662314783325/posts/V8Y648iKde6).\r\n\r\nFollowing the consultation, the target

issue the team would like answers to the following questions:\r\n\r\n1. Have any of these structures been screened against Malaria and if so, what activities did they show?\r\nEach structure should be searched in PubChem (http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) and ChEMBL (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/) databases to identify any active compounds and the results posted.\r\n2.  Are any of these compounds/analogs commercially available?\r\nBefore embarking on synthesis, the team would like to establish whether suitable analogs can be purchased. Commercial databases should be searched and results posted.\r\n3. Do existing syntheses exist?\r\nIf suitable commercial analogs cannot be sourced, proposed synthetic routes (ideally with referenced literature procedures) should be posted.\r\n\r\nOnce questions 1-3 have been answered and results posted in the GitHub comment. The author should make a conclusion on viability/importantance of the target based on their findings. The issue can be marked as resolved and findings discussed in the next open meeting (https://plus.google.com/u/0/114702323662314783325/posts/V8Y648iKde6).\r\n\r\nFollowing the consultation, the target

issue the team would like answers to the following questions:\r\n\r\n1. Have any of these structures been screened against Malaria and if so, what activities did they show?\r\nEach structure should be searched in PubChem (http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) and ChEMBL (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/) databases to identify any active compounds and the results posted.\r\n2.  Are any of these compounds/analogs commercially available?\r\nBefore embarking on synthesis, the team would like to establish whether suitable analogs can be purchased. Commercial databases should be searched and results posted.\r\n3. Do existing syntheses exist?\r\nIf suitable commercial analogs cannot be sourced, proposed synthetic routes (ideally with referenced literature procedures) should be posted.\r\n\r\nOnce questions 1-3 have been answered and results posted in the GitHub comment. The author should make a conclusion on viability/importantance of the target based on their findings. The issue can be marked as resolved and findings discussed in the next open meeting (https://plus.google.com/u/0/114702323662314783325/posts/V8Y648iKde6).\r\n\r\nFollowing the consultation, the target compounds will be highlighted and summarised in the public

issue the team would like answers to the following questions:\r\n\r\n1. Have any of these structures been screened against Malaria and if so, what activities did they show?\r\nEach structure should be searched in PubChem (http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) and ChEMBL (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/) databases to identify any active compounds and the results posted.\r\n2.  Are any of these compounds/analogs commercially available?\r\nBefore embarking on synthesis, the team would like to establish whether suitable analogs can be purchased. Commercial databases should be searched and results posted.\r\n3. Do existing syntheses exist?\r\nIf suitable commercial analogs cannot be sourced, proposed synthetic routes (ideally with referenced literature procedures) should be posted.\r\n\r\nOnce questions 1-3 have been answered and results posted in the GitHub comment. The author should make a conclusion on viability/importantance of the target based on their findings. The issue can be marked as resolved and findings discussed in the next open meeting (https://plus.google.com/u/0/114702323662314783325/posts/V8Y648iKde6).\r\n\r\nFollowing the consultation, the target

issue the team would like answers to the following questions:\r\n\r\n1. Have any of these structures been screened against Malaria and if so, what activities did they show?\r\nEach structure should be searched in PubChem (http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) and ChEMBL (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/) databases to identify any active compounds and the results posted.\r\n2.  Are any of these compounds/analogs commercially available?\r\nBefore embarking on synthesis, the team would like to establish whether suitable analogs can be purchased. Commercial databases should be searched and results posted.\r\n3. Do existing syntheses exist?\r\nIf suitable commercial analogs cannot be sourced, proposed synthetic routes (ideally with referenced literature procedures) should be posted.\r\n\r\nOnce questions 1-3 have been answered and results posted in the GitHub comment. The author should make a conclusion on viability/importantance of the target based on their findings. The issue can be marked as resolved and findings discussed in the next open meeting (https://plus.google.com/u/0/114702323662314783325/posts/V8Y648iKde6).\r\n\r\nFollowing the consultation, the target

The data ought to be on the wiki, presumably? Given the latest data from the aminothienopyrimidine series, we *might* have to start thinking about alternative series. Paul W will be in touch with GSK about that if needed, but these kinds of searches are very useful to inform that. So first step - get the data out there on a page on the wiki (may need to create) and add disclaimer that the data may change over time and needs periodic updating (by anyone who wishes to do so).\r\n\r\n![series 1 summary](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/4386101/492382/3c4a6d52-baa2-11e2-95aa-49d4a817d360.png)"},

Are any of these compounds/analogs commercially available?\r\nBefore embarking on synthesis, the team would like to establish whether suitable analogs can be purchased. Commercial databases should be searched and results posted.\r\n3. Do existing syntheses exist?\r\nIf suitable commercial analogs cannot be sourced, proposed synthetic routes (ideally with referenced literature procedures) should be posted.\r\n\r\nOnce questions 1-3 have been answered and results posted in the GitHub comment. The author should make a conclusion on viability/importantance of the target based on their findings. The issue can be marked as resolved and findings discussed in the next open meeting (https://plus.google.com/u/0/114702323662314783325/posts/V8Y648iKde6).\r\n\r\nFollowing the consultation, the target

issue the team would like answers to the following questions:\r\n\r\n1. Have any of these structures been screened against Malaria and if so, what activities did they show?\r\nEach structure should be searched in PubChem (http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) and ChEMBL (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/) databases to identify any active compounds and the results posted.\r\n2.  Are any of these compounds/analogs commercially available?\r\nBefore embarking on synthesis, the team would like to establish whether suitable analogs can be purchased. Commercial databases should be searched and results posted.\r\n3. Do existing syntheses exist?\r\nIf suitable commercial analogs cannot be sourced, proposed synthetic routes (ideally with referenced literature procedures) should be posted.\r\n\r\nOnce questions 1-3 have been answered and results posted in the GitHub comment. The author should make a conclusion on viability/importantance of the target based on their findings. The issue can be marked as resolved and findings discussed in the next open meeting (https://plus.google.com/u/0/114702323662314783325/posts/V8Y648iKde6).\r\n\r\nFollowing the consultation, the target compounds will be highlighted and summarised in the public domain.", "creator"=>{"login"=>"alintheopen", "id"=>2626599,

The data ought to be on the wiki, presumably? Given the latest data from the aminothienopyrimidine series, we *might* have to start thinking about alternative series. Paul W will be in touch with GSK about that if needed, but these kinds of searches are very useful to inform that. So first step - get the data out there on a page on the wiki (may need to create) and add disclaimer that the data may change over time and needs periodic updating (by anyone who wishes to do so).\r\n\r\n![series 1 summary](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/4386101/492382/3c4a6d52-baa2-11e2-95aa-49d4a817d360.png)"},

Are any of these compounds/analogs commercially available?\r\nBefore embarking on synthesis, the team would like to establish whether suitable analogs can be purchased. Commercial databases should be searched and results posted.\r\n3. Do existing syntheses exist?\r\nIf suitable commercial analogs cannot be sourced, proposed synthetic routes (ideally with referenced literature procedures) should be posted.\r\n\r\nOnce questions 1-3 have been answered and results posted in the GitHub comment. The author should make a conclusion on viability/importantance of the target based on their findings. The issue can be marked as resolved and findings discussed in the next open meeting (https://plus.google.com/u/0/114702323662314783325/posts/V8Y648iKde6).\r\n\r\nFollowing the consultation, the target

issue the team would like answers to the following questions:\r\n\r\n1. Have any of these structures been screened against Malaria and if so, what activities did they show?\r\nEach structure should be searched in PubChem (http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) and ChEMBL (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/) databases to identify any active compounds and the results posted.\r\n2.  Are any of these compounds/analogs commercially available?\r\nBefore embarking on synthesis, the team would like to establish whether suitable analogs can be purchased. Commercial databases should be searched and results posted.\r\n3. Do existing syntheses exist?\r\nIf suitable commercial analogs cannot be sourced, proposed synthetic routes (ideally with referenced literature procedures) should be posted.\r\n\r\nOnce questions 1-3 have been answered and results posted in the GitHub comment. The author should make a conclusion on viability/importantance of the target based on their findings. The issue can be marked as resolved and findings discussed in the next open meeting (https://plus.google.com/u/0/114702323662314783325/posts/V8Y648iKde6).\r\n\r\nFollowing the consultation, the target compounds will be highlighted and summarised in the public domain.", "creator"=>{"login"=>"alintheopen", "id"=>2626599,

The data ought to be on the wiki, presumably? Given the latest data from the aminothienopyrimidine series, we *might* have to start thinking about alternative series. Paul W will be in touch with GSK about that if needed, but these kinds of searches are very useful to inform that. So first step - get the data out there on a page on the wiki (may need to create) and add disclaimer that the data may change over time and needs periodic updating (by anyone who wishes to do so).\r\n\r\n![series 1 summary](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/4386101/492382/3c4a6d52-baa2-11e2-95aa-49d4a817d360.png)"},

Are any of these compounds/analogs commercially available?\r\nBefore embarking on synthesis, the team would like to establish whether suitable analogs can be purchased. Commercial databases should be searched and results posted.\r\n3. Do existing syntheses exist?\r\nIf suitable commercial analogs cannot be sourced, proposed synthetic routes (ideally with referenced literature procedures) should be posted.\r\n\r\nOnce questions 1-3 have been answered and results posted in the GitHub comment. The author should make a conclusion on viability/importantance of the target based on their findings. The issue can be marked as resolved and findings discussed in the next open meeting (https://plus.google.com/u/0/114702323662314783325/posts/V8Y648iKde6).\r\n\r\nFollowing the consultation, the target

issue the team would like answers to the following questions:\r\n\r\n1. Have any of these structures been screened against Malaria and if so, what activities did they show?\r\nEach structure should be searched in PubChem (http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) and ChEMBL (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/) databases to identify any active compounds and the results posted.\r\n2.  Are any of these compounds/analogs commercially available?\r\nBefore embarking on synthesis, the team would like to establish whether suitable analogs can be purchased. Commercial databases should be searched and results posted.\r\n3. Do existing syntheses exist?\r\nIf suitable commercial analogs cannot be sourced, proposed synthetic routes (ideally with referenced literature procedures) should be posted.\r\n\r\nOnce questions 1-3 have been answered and results posted in the GitHub comment. The author should make a conclusion on viability/importantance of the target based on their findings. The issue can be marked as resolved and findings discussed in the next open meeting (https://plus.google.com/u/0/114702323662314783325/posts/V8Y648iKde6).\r\n\r\nFollowing the consultation, the target

Are any of these compounds/analogs commercially available?\r\nBefore embarking on synthesis, the team would like to establish whether suitable analogs can be purchased. Commercial databases should be searched and results posted.\r\n3. Do existing syntheses exist?\r\nIf suitable commercial analogs cannot be sourced, proposed synthetic routes (ideally with referenced literature procedures) should be posted.\r\n\r\nOnce questions 1-3 have been answered and results posted in the GitHub comment. The author should make a conclusion on viability/importantance of the target based on their findings.

issue the team would like answers to the following questions:\r\n\r\n1. Have any of these structures been screened against Malaria and if so, what activities did they show?\r\nEach structure should be searched in PubChem (http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) and ChEMBL (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/) databases to identify any active compounds and the results posted.\r\n2.  Are any of these compounds/analogs commercially available?\r\nBefore embarking on synthesis, the team would like to establish whether suitable analogs can be purchased. Commercial databases should be searched and results posted.\r\n3. Do existing syntheses exist?\r\nIf suitable commercial analogs cannot be sourced, proposed synthetic routes (ideally with referenced literature procedures) should be posted.\r\n\r\nOnce questions 1-3 have been answered and results posted in the GitHub comment. The author should make a conclusion on viability/importantance of the target based on their findings. The issue can be marked as resolved and findings discussed in the next open meeting (https://plus.google.com/u/0/114702323662314783325/posts/V8Y648iKde6).\r\n\r\nFollowing the consultation, the target compounds will be highlighted and summarised in the public domain.", "creator"=>{"login"=>"alintheopen", "id"=>2626599,

The data ought to be on the wiki, presumably? Given the latest data from the aminothienopyrimidine series, we *might* have to start thinking about alternative series. Paul W will be in touch with GSK about that if needed, but these kinds of searches are very useful to inform that. So first step - get the data out there on a page on the wiki (may need to create) and add disclaimer that the data may change over time and needs periodic updating (by anyone who wishes to do so).\r\n\r\n![series 1 summary](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/4386101/492382/3c4a6d52-baa2-11e2-95aa-49d4a817d360.png)"},

Are any of these compounds/analogs commercially available?\r\nBefore embarking on synthesis, the team would like to establish whether suitable analogs can be purchased. Commercial databases should be searched and results posted.\r\n3. Do existing syntheses exist?\r\nIf suitable commercial analogs cannot be sourced, proposed synthetic routes (ideally with referenced literature procedures) should be posted.\r\n\r\nOnce questions 1-3 have been answered and results posted in the GitHub comment. The author should make a conclusion on viability/importantance of the target based on their findings. The issue can be marked as resolved and findings discussed in the next open meeting (https://plus.google.com/u/0/114702323662314783325/posts/V8Y648iKde6).\r\n\r\nFollowing the consultation, the target

issue the team would like answers to the following questions:\r\n\r\n1. Have any of these structures been screened against Malaria and if so, what activities did they show?\r\nEach structure should be searched in PubChem (http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) and ChEMBL (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/) databases to identify any active compounds and the results posted.\r\n2.  Are any of these compounds/analogs commercially available?\r\nBefore embarking on synthesis, the team would like to establish whether suitable analogs can be purchased. Commercial databases should be searched and results posted.\r\n3. Do existing syntheses exist?\r\nIf suitable commercial analogs cannot be sourced, proposed synthetic routes (ideally with referenced literature procedures) should be posted.\r\n\r\nOnce questions 1-3 have been answered and results posted in the GitHub comment. The author should make a conclusion on viability/importantance of the target based on their findings. The issue can be marked as resolved and findings discussed in the next open meeting (https://plus.google.com/u/0/114702323662314783325/posts/V8Y648iKde6).\r\n\r\nFollowing the consultation, the target

Are any of these compounds/analogs commercially available?\r\nBefore embarking on synthesis, the team would like to establish whether suitable analogs can be purchased. Commercial databases should be searched and results posted.\r\n3. Do existing syntheses exist?\r\nIf suitable commercial analogs cannot be sourced, proposed synthetic routes (ideally with referenced literature procedures) should be posted.\r\n\r\nOnce questions 1-3 have been answered and results posted in the GitHub comment. The author should make a conclusion on viability/importantance of the target based on their findings.

issue the team would like answers to the following questions:\r\n\r\n1. Have any of these structures been screened against Malaria and if so, what activities did they show?\r\nEach structure should be searched in PubChem (http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) and ChEMBL (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/) databases to identify any active compounds and the results posted.\r\n2.  Are any of these compounds/analogs commercially available?\r\nBefore embarking on synthesis, the team would like to establish whether suitable analogs can be purchased. Commercial databases should be searched and results posted.\r\n3. Do existing syntheses exist?\r\nIf suitable commercial analogs cannot be sourced, proposed synthetic routes (ideally with referenced literature procedures) should be posted.\r\n\r\nOnce questions 1-3 have been answered and results posted in the GitHub comment. The author should make a conclusion on viability/importantance of the target based on their findings. The issue can be marked as resolved and findings discussed in the next open meeting (https://plus.google.com/u/0/114702323662314783325/posts/V8Y648iKde6).\r\n\r\nFollowing the consultation, the target compounds will be highlighted and summarised in the public domain.", "creator"=>{"login"=>"alintheopen", "id"=>2626599,

The data ought to be on the wiki, presumably? Given the latest data from the aminothienopyrimidine series, we *might* have to start thinking about alternative series. Paul W will be in touch with GSK about that if needed, but these kinds of searches are very useful to inform that. So first step - get the data out there on a page on the wiki (may need to create) and add disclaimer that the data may change over time and needs periodic updating (by anyone who wishes to do so).\r\n\r\n![series 1 summary](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/4386101/492382/3c4a6d52-baa2-11e2-95aa-49d4a817d360.png)"},

Are any of these compounds/analogs commercially available?\r\nBefore embarking on synthesis, the team would like to establish whether suitable analogs can be purchased. Commercial databases should be searched and results posted.\r\n3. Do existing syntheses exist?\r\nIf suitable commercial analogs cannot be sourced, proposed synthetic routes (ideally with referenced literature procedures) should be posted.\r\n\r\nOnce questions 1-3 have been answered and results posted in the GitHub comment. The author should make a conclusion on viability/importantance of the target based on their findings. The issue can be marked as resolved and findings discussed in the next open meeting (https://plus.google.com/u/0/114702323662314783325/posts/V8Y648iKde6).\r\n\r\nFollowing the consultation, the target
