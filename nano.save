issue the team would like answers to the following questions:\r\n\r\n1. Have any of these structures been screened against Malaria and if so, what activities did they show?\r\nEach structure should be searched in PubChem (http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) and ChEMBL (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/) databases to identify any active compounds and the results posted.\r\n2. Are any of these compounds/analogs commercially available?\r\nBefore embarking on synthesis, the team would like to establish whether suitable analogs can be purchased. Commercial databases should be searched and results posted.\r\n3. Do existing syntheses exist?\r\nIf suitable commercial analogs cannot be sourced, proposed synthetic routes (ideally with referenced literature procedures) should be posted.\r\n\r\nOnce questions 1-3 have been answered and results posted in the GitHub comment. The author should make a conclusion on viability/importantance of the target based on their findings. The issue can be marked as resolved and findings discussed in the next open meeting (https://plus.google.com/u/0/114702323662314783325/posts/V8Y648iKde6).\r\n\r\nFollowing the consultation, the target compounds will be highlighted and summarised in the public domain.","creator":{"login":"alintheopen","id":2626599,"avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/c2471ff5e662c17f7a0455ab67d97729?d=https://a248.e.akamai.net/assets.github.com%2Fimages%2Fgravatars%2Fgravatar-user-420.png","gravatar_id":"c2471ff5e662c17f7a0455ab67d97729","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alintheopen","html_url":"https://github.com/alintheopen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alintheopen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alintheopen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alintheopen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alintheopen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alintheopen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alintheopen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alintheopen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alintheopen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alintheopen/received_events","type":"User"},"open_issues":1,"closed_issues":7,"state":"open","created_at":"2013-05-10T05:12:06Z","updated_at":"2013-05-13T05:50:14Z","due_on":"2013-05-13T07:00:00Z"},"comments":5,"created_at":"2013-05-10T06:44:29Z","updated_at":"2013-05-20T00:40:29Z","closed_at":null,"pull_request":{"html_url":null,"diff_url":null,"patch_url":null},"body":"![github7](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/2626599/486894/2bed8c20-b93d-11e2-9412-0d192c265a62.png)\r\nInChI=1S/C13H12N4O2S/c14-10-5-2-6-11-12(10)17-13(16-11)8-3-1-4-9(7-8)20(15,18)19/h1-7H,14H2,(H,16,17)(H2,15,18,19)"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OSDDMalaria/OSDDMalaria_To_Do_List/issues/4","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OSDDMalaria/OSDDMalaria_To_Do_List/issues/4/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OSDDMalaria/OSDDMalaria_To_Do_List/issues/4/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OSDDMalaria/OSDDMalaria_To_Do_List/issues/4/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OSDDMalaria/OSDDMalaria_To_Do_List/issues/4","id":14137286,"number":4,"title":"Remake
